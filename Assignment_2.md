# Assignment 3: Object Detection and Tracking with Deep Learning (Revised)
In this project, you will delve into the realm of object detection and tracking utilizing deep learning models. Your task will involve utilizing a pre-trained object detection model to identify and locate objects within images or video streams. Subsequently, you will extend this model's capabilities to track objects across a sequence of frames. This assignment offers a practical introduction to the core concepts of object detection and tracking, challenging you to apply these in a real-world scenario.

## Objectives
- Gain an understanding of object detection models and their application using pre-trained deep learning architectures.
- Implement object tracking to follow objects across a sequence of images or video frames, integrating it with the detection model.
- Experiment with the model on a chosen dataset to observe its detection and tracking capabilities.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the model in object detection and tracking, identifying challenges and discussing potential enhancements.

## Instructions

### 1. Research and Model Selection (3 points)
- **Research**: Explore various deep learning models widely recognized for object detection and tracking, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), and Faster R-CNN.
- **Model Selection**: Select one pre-trained model for object detection based on its reported performance metrics, compatibility with your dataset, and real-time processing capabilities. Justify your choice.

### 2. Data Collection and Preparation (2 points)
- **Dataset**: Identify or gather a dataset apt for object detection and tracking. This dataset can either be publicly available or self-compiled, provided it is adequately annotated for object detection tasks.  For tracking, ensure the dataset contains a sequence of images or video frames.
- **Preprocessing**: Prepare your dataset for application. This may include resizing or filtering images if necessary, and normalizing pixel values to suit your chosen model's requirements.

### 3. Implementation (5 points)
- **Object Detection**: Implement the selected pre-trained object detection model using TensorFlow or PyTorch. Opt for a model from a reputable source such as TensorFlow Model Zoo, PyTorch Hub, or a credible GitHub repository.
- **Object Tracking**: Augment your object detection model with tracking functionality. Implement simple to advanced tracking algorithms based on your project's needs.
- **Documentation**: Ensure your implementation is well-documented, with comments explaining crucial sections. Properly cite all external sources of information or code utilized.

### 4. Evaluation (3 points)
- **Deployment**: Apply your model to the dataset. While fine-tuning is not required, ensure the model is appropriately configured to handle your specific dataset effectively.
- **Performance Analysis**: Assess your model's performance using suitable metrics, focusing on detection accuracy (e.g., mean Average Precision, mAP) and tracking precision (e.g., Intersection over Union, IoU).

### 5. Analysis and Discussion (2 points)
